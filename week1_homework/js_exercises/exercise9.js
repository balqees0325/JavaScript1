// y=21;
// y = y%4;
// y after calculation is going to be 1;
// here % (which means modulo) checks for when we divide 21 by 4 what will be remainder value, i.e 4 goes into 21 5x, 4*5=20 +1(remainder) which gives 21;


//question 3;
// z = 13;
// z = z%2;
// the value of z after calculation is going to be 1;
// here % (which means modulo) checks for when we divide 13 by 2 what will be remainder value, i.e 2 goes into 13 6x, 2*6=12 +1(remainder) which gives 13;
